Here are some building blocks of an approach to life and money.

I like to understand how different ideas and concepts fit together, and how they interact with each other.

As an example, following a certain philosophy to life (e.g. minimalism) will reduce your expenditure dramatically, and then in turn you’ll need to save up less to be able to retire. Investing the money you save, will accelerate the retirement as you’ll benefit from compound interest. You'll have to use certain practical tools, like ISAs, pensions, investment accounts and budget trackers to enable this.

Jacob Lund Fisker at [Extreme Retirement Early](https://wiki.earlyretirementextreme.com/) takes this to the next level with a [systems thinking](https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/how-to-think-in-systems-great-and-accessible-and-short-book/) perspective. He talks about a _"Web of Goals"_, where _"negative side-effects are eliminated as far as possible and goals are chosen to have mutually reinforcing positive side effects... complex arrangement of highly efficient choices that produce a given standard-of-living for much less than the normal cost or a higher standard-of-living at the same cost."_

I’m not going to dictate your choices, but my hope is that being aware and understanding these aspects of money will allow you to build your own approach to life and money, and a set of principles that supports them.
