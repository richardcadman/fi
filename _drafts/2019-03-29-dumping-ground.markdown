**Financial independence** = having enough wealth to live on, or assets generating enough income, such that you don’t need to work a “normal job” anymore.

#### This blog will focus on three rough aspects:
- The **mathematical and rational side of money**: the basic concepts of financial independence, and broader financial concepts like interest, compounding, debt, etc
- The **practical and emotional side of money**: where to put your money, how to systemise / form habits, how we think and feel about money, irrational stuff we do etc
- The **philosophical and conceptual side of money**: the why of financial independence, consumerism, simple living, what is money _really_ etc
