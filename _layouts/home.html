    <h1 class="post-list-heading">On Financial Independence</h1>
    <p>|<i> A holistic take on financial independence, and how to get there, from a uk-based mid twenty-something.</i></p>
    <p>Financial independence = having enough wealth to live on, or assets generating enough income, such that you don‚Äôt need to work a ‚Äúnormal job‚Äù anymore.</p>
    <p>It's an attractive idea, but requires a decent amount of thought, and effort, to actually make it happen. You'll probably have to spend some time thinking about what you value in life too, which is always fun.</p>
    <p>My aim is to help with that some of that stuff.</p>
    <p>I've categorised things you need to think about into three areas. This site is a fun way for me to learn more about the ideas in each of the areas, and hopefully share my thoughts with anyone that cares.
