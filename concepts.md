Here are some building blocks of an approach to life and money.

I like to understand how different ideas and concepts fit together, and how they interact with each other. For example, following a minimalist approach to life will reduce your expenditure dramatically, and then in turn you’ll need to save up less to be able to retire. Investing the money you save, will accelerate the retirement as you’ll benefit from compound interest.

I’m not going to dictate your choices, but my hope is that being aware and understanding these aspects of money will allow you to build your own approach to life and money, and a set of principles that supports them.

### The mathematical/conceptual side of money:
Financial concepts like interest, compounding, debt, etc
- Interest, savings, debt
- Compounding
- Savings rates
- Pensions (and tax)
- Retirement (how much you need)

### The practical/rational side of money:
Where to put your money, how to systemise / form habits, etc
Tools: what tools to use, how to choose them
Bank
Pension
Investing
Systems: build the right habits, take the right approach to money
Measure what matters
Budgeting

### The emotive/irrational side of money:
How to talk about it and how we think and feel about it, etc
- Behavioural Economics
- Tricks that you’ll be falling for
- “Debt isn't a maths problem — it's a psychological problem”

### The philosophical side of money:
What is money, debt, consumerism, how we choose to live etc
- Money
- Debt
- Capitalism
- Consumerism
- Materialism
- Systems Thinking Approach
- Simple Living / Minimalism
- Financial Independence
