A more thoughtful, holistic perspective on reaching financial independence.

**Financial independence** = having enough wealth to live on, or assets generating enough income, such that you don’t need to work a “normal job” anymore.

#### This blog will focus on three rough aspects:
- The **mathematical and rational side of money**: the basic concepts of financial independence, and broader financial concepts like interest, compounding, debt, etc
- The **practical and emotional side of money**: where to put your money, how to systemise / form habits, how we think and feel about money, irrational stuff we do etc
- The **philosophical and conceptual side of money**: the why of financial independence, consumerism, simple living, what is money _really_ etc  

#### For context on me:
- I’m in my mid-twenties, london-based, and work in the tech sector
- I did pretty well at school, and went to a decent uni to study engineering
- After a very short stint (< 1yr) in a “professional services job” I binned that off and chose not to bother with the typical consulting/law/banking plan
- Instead, I chose to do something that actually interest me and aligns better with my values
- I like questioning things, understanding why we do the things we do, as individuals and more generally as a human race, we're fascinating

#### Disclaimer:

I wanna point out that these are just opinions, albeit strong ones, loosely held. It’s probably fair to assume that I’ve already changed my mind on some of these too. One thing's for sure, this isn't financial advice.
