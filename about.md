A more thoughtful, holistic perspective on reaching financial independence.

**Financial independence** = having enough wealth to live on, or assets generating enough income, such that you don’t need to work a “normal job” anymore.

#### This blog will focus on four rough aspects:
- The **mathematical side of money**: financial concepts like interest, compounding, debt, etc
- The **practical side of money**: where to put your money, how to systemise / form habits, etc
- The **emotive side of money**: how we think and feel about it, our irrationality etc
- The **philosophical side of money**: what is money, debt, consumerism, simple living etc  

#### For context on me:
- I’m in my mid-twenties, london-based, and work in the tech sector
- I did pretty well at school, and went to a decent uni to study engineering
- After a very short stint (< 1yr) in a “professional services job” I binned that off and chose not to bother with the typical consulting/law/banking plan
- Instead, I chose to do something that actually interest me and aligns better with my values
- I intensely love questioning things, understanding why we do the things we do, as individuals and more generally as a human race

#### Disclaimer:

I wanna point out that these are just opinions, albeit strong ones, loosely held. It’s probably fair to assume that I’ve already changed my mind on some of these too. Also, disclaimer, one thing this is definitely _not_ is financial advice.
